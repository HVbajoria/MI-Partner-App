## Theme : 
To create a billing app integrated across all devices (mobiles and PCs) and outlets to be used by the vendor/operator at the Point of Sale (POS).

## Problem Statement :
Providing great customer service and understanding their pain points is the aim of each and every organization. There has been some scope of improvement in the real-time service provided across all MY outlets to its customers to process the custom orders in an efficient way.
* There has been no feature to allow the customer to show the picture of a product and get the most similar one across all MI outlets unless the executive is knowledgeable enough.
* No feature to allow direct access to the pre-existing cart built by the customer in a secured manner.
* Lack of a recommendation system for the executive to get the best products that aligns with the customer purchase which will help him/her increase sales.
* The customer needs to get the documents by themselves to claim the warranty of a product which sometimes gives them a bad experience.

## Solution :
**MI Partner App** is the solution to the above problems that will help to ease the billing process across all Mi outlets by allowing the store operators to process customer orders in real-time through various devices thereby increasing speed and efficiency and ultimately increasing customer satisfaction with security and trust bringing in the culture of the organization to the consumer.
* This app will run only on registered devices which will help the store executives get enhanced security.
* It will allow the customer to upload an image of the product they wish to purchase and using computer vision get the similar product in seconds,
* It will be providing the executive with the power of a robust recommendation system baked by a machine learning model to help suggest the best products that go with the purchased item and enhance sales.
* It will allow the customer to share the pre-build cart with the store which can help save time and energy for both the parties.
* The store will be able to look at the past records through a database to initiate the warranty and 30-days return policy easily making the whole process smooth and efficient.

## Tech Stack :
The following tech stacks can be used in order to build the application and using Microsoft Azure get the security and AI services we require. 
* **Flutter** to build the application.
* **Microsoft Azure** services to host the app and get the IT infrastructure required.
* **Microsoft Azure Computer Vision Services** to get the power of computer vision models.
* **MongoDB database** to store and manage the data which is uploaded, processed in relational databases.

## Methodology :
The methodology for the store executive will work in the following way to allow the smooth flow of the steps and allow him/her to give the best customer experience to its customers along with the opportunities to increase its sales as much as possible by providing the right and most-worked suggestions.

For adding products into the cart of the customer with in-store purchase the workflow is as follows :

For the whole consumer journey from entering the store to being a part of the MI community works in the following manner :

## Social Impact / Novelty :
This application will ease the billing process across all Mi outlets by allowing the store operators to process customer orders in real-time through various devices thereby increasing speed and efficiency and ultimately increasing customer satisfaction with security and trust bringing in the culture of the organization to the consumer.
* It will bring in the power of AI and ML to help the operators be the best technical guide for them to help them choose the best and latest accessories based on their needs and requirements.
* It will help the customers feel the culture of harmony and inclusion by allowing the operators to easily include their suggestions and needs while showcasing products and services.
* It will bring in security in the system which is important to build confidence and trust for both the customer and the operator.
* This efficient system backed with AI will help ease the process and give the best experience to the consumer without the condition of having a knowledgeable and empathy operator.
* Finally, with this overall system the consumer would feel belonged and become a part of the community to help get the best marketing done for the services and products offered by the organization.

## Future Scope :
If this application is adopted in MI stores I believe :
* It can help increase speed, ease the whole workflow to give the best experience and satisfaction to the customer.
* If integrated with blockchain it can help in more secure storage of data in the database, hence bringing in more trust and security into the system.
* The machine learning models can be implemented and made more accurate by feeding more data to allow the operators to give the best suggestions to the customer.
* It will help increase the conversion rate and enhance sales at each and every outlet and give the same best experience to the customer.
* It will help add in more loyal community members to purchase products and services because of their experience.
