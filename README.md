## Theme : 
To create a billing app integrated across all devices (mobiles and PCs) and outlets to be used by the vendor/operator at the Point of Sale (POS).

## Problem Statement :
Providing a great customer service and understanding their pain points is the aim of each and every organization. There has been some scope of improvement in the real-time service provided cross all MI outlets to its customers to procerss the custom orders in an efficient way.
* There has been no feature to allow the customer to show the picture of a product and get the most similar one across all MI outlets unless the executive is knowledgable enough.
* No feature to allow direct access to the pre-existing cart built by customer in a secured manner.
* Lack of recommendation system for the executive to get the best products that aligns with the customer purchase which will help him/her increase sales.
* The customer needs to get the documents by themselves to claim the warranty of a product which sometimes gives them a bad experience.

## Solution :
**MI Partner App** is the solution to the above problems that will help to ease the billing process across all Mi outlets by allowing the store operators to process customer orders in real-time through various devices thereby increasing speed and efficiency and ultimately increasing customer satisfaction with security and trust bringing in the culture of the organization to the consumer.
* This app will run only on registered devices which will help the store executuvies get a enhanced security.
* It will allow the customer to upload an image of the product they wish to purchase and using computer vision get the similar product in seconds,
* It will be providing the executive with the power of a robust recommendation system baked by machine learning model to help suggest the best produts that go with the purchased item and enhanace sales.
* It will allow the customer to share the pre-build cart with the store which can help save timee and energy for both the parties.
* The store will be able to look at the past records through a databse to initiate the warranty and 30-days return policy easily making the whole process smooth and efficient.

## Tech Stack :
The following tech stacks can be used in order to build the application and using Microsoft Azure get the security and AI services we require. 
* **Flutter** to build the application.
* **Microsoft Azure** services to host the app and get the IT infrastructure required.
* **Microsoft Azure Computer Vision Services** to take get the power of computer vision models.
* **MongoDB database** to store and manage the data which is uploaded, processed in relational databases.
